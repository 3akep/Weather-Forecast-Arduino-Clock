# Weather Forecast Arduino Clock
Weather forecast, clock and alarm using Arduino, Nokia 5110, DS1307 RTC and BME280

Come back to check for new versions.

So far, besides the clock itself, these are the functions that this project is already supporting:

+ Time and date display (as well as time and activation of alarm on the same screen)
+ Screen lights up in dark conditions or when movement is detected (based on changes of light)
+ Weather forecast (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
+ Display of temperature, pressure and humidity (for humidity it will indicate whether it's too dry)
+ Menu for settings: alarm, changing time, enable/disable date display, enable/disable weather change sound notifications and switch between imperial and metric units
+ Alarm settings - on/off, setting the time, setting the melody and/or bells for notifications
